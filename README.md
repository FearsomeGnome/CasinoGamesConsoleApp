 C++ Simple casino games to play in console
The final project for intro to C++ is to create a casino games app
that is playable in the console.

The user should be able to choose between Blackjack and Roulette.

The user should have a starting amount of money and be able to bet
before each turn is played.

Blackjack should follow the normal rules of the game - dealing two
cards to the house and player, and so on.

Roulette should allow the player to bet on a number and then have
a random number chosen as the winning number to see if the player
wins or looses.

If the user runs out of money the game should end.
